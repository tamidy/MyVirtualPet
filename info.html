    <p class="backstory"> This is my rabbit, High Tops. I adopted him when I was 12 years old. Every year, I would go to the county fair with my family, and one of my favorite parts of the fair was the rabbit farm. Along the walls, through the middle of the room, stretching across to the other side of the buiiding, rabbits are everywhere. Seeing how utterly adorable they were, I had always wanted a rabbit of my own, and one year, my wish finally came true. </p>
    
    <p class="backstory"> The rabbit farm was a very lonely place. The rabbits were always being transported and kept in individual cages, and not leaving enough space in the cage to play. The love and care of the employees must have been distributed among the countless number of rabbits, leaving holes in the rabbits' hearts.  The food bowls and water bottles were very small, allowing for only a small amount of food at a time, in addition to the many rabbits needing to be fed and the limited amount of food. His prior living conditions were the cause of his behavior now.</p>
    
    <p class="backstory"> High Tops gets hungry every 10 seconds. He's always waiting for me to feed him. The only thing that makes him happy is playing, so I play with him often. Because he plays so much, if you just cradle him, he'll get sleepy. So, unless it's his bedtime, I avoid cradling him too much. All he wants to do is play, so he gets bored if I just pet him. Due to his life of loneliness before I adopted him, he gets sad when he feels he's being ignored, so I give him a lot of attention. </p>
      
    <p class="backstory"> He may be a handful, but he is a very peaceful and reliable friend to have, and I recommend everyone to adopt a rabbit, if you can handle the amount of cuteness! </p>
